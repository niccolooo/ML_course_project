1. Exploratory analysis of the data with plotting

2. Delete all columns which are NA in testing set

3. create test (80%) and CV (20%) set in testing set

4. apply random forest to learn a classification model of "classe from the following variables:
modFit2 <- train (classe ~  roll_belt + yaw_belt + total_accel_belt + gyros_belt_z + accel_belt_z + magnet_belt_y + gyros_dumbbell_x + gyros_dumbbell_y + accel_dumbbell_x + accel_dumbbell_y + pitch_forearm + magnet_forearm_z , method = "rf" ,  data = trainingSet)

The model seems to be affected by overfitting. Below, the training set confusion matrix is reported.

trainingPred  A  B  C  D  E
           A 85  0  0  0  0
           B  2 64  1  0  0
           C  0  0 53  0  0
           D  1  0  2 56  0
           E  0  0  0  0 64

Overall Statistics
                                          
               Accuracy : 0.9817          
                 95% CI : (0.9606, 0.9933)
    No Information Rate : 0.2683          
    P-Value [Acc > NIR] : < 2.2e-16    
    


And the CVSet confusion matrix:
testingPred  A  B  C  D  E
          A 18  1  0  0  0
          B  0  8  2  0  1
          C  0  1 10  2  1
          D  2  4  2 11  0
          E  1  1  0  0 13

Overall Statistics
                                        
               Accuracy : 0.7692        
                 95% CI : (0.66, 0.8571)
    No Information Rate : 0.2692        
    P-Value [Acc > NIR] : < 2.2e-16     
                                        
                  Kappa : 0.7106        
 Mcnemar's Test P-Value : NA  
    
    
 Adopting the developed model, the following classification is obtained for the testing set:
  A C B C A E D D A A B C B A E E A B A B
